about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I'm a Senior Research Associate in Sociophonetics at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/about/people/robert-lennon). My research is in sociolinguistics, phonetics and speech perception, and I'm interested in the social aspects of speech communities, and the ways in which they affect how people produce, perceive, and learn speech sounds.
  
  My expertise is in Scottish and Northern English accents (especially phonetic variation in Glasgow), rhoticity, and cross-dialect perception, and I have also worked on perception of speech tempo and phonetic reduction.
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>Phonetics teaching</mark>, <mark>Sociolinguistics teaching</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>Praat</mark> and <mark>Perception experiments</mark>

            ***Changing /r/ accents? Towards a sociophonological understanding of sound change***
            
            We are using a variety of methods to investigate residual rhoticity in Blackburn, Lancashire (where many speakers still pronounce the /r/ in words like *car* and *third*), examining the mechanisms by which it is changing over time.

            ***English Language and Linguistics***
            
            I delivered teaching, supervision and assessment on theoretical, instrumental and articulatory Phonetics (segmental and prosodic approaches), variationist Sociolinguistics, and general linguistics at all levels from Level 1 to PGT. I was course convenor for both Honours and PGT Sociolinguistics courses, and I was the Level 2 year group convenor for the linguistics department.

            ***Speech tempo perception and missing sounds***
            
            In this project we investigated the link between laboratory measurements of speech tempo and how listeners perceive speaking rate. I designed and ran a suite of speech perception experiments, maintained a large phonetically-aligned corpus, and contributed to analysis, conference presentations and journal submissions.

            While completing my Phd I worked on multiple funded projects run by researchers from different universities. Tasks included:
            - Statistical analysis, transcription work
            - Writing contributions to research outputs
            - Participant recruitment and recording
